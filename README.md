# Customer Demo App

## Project Breif

Create a single page app that will allow potential customers of foodbomb to search suppliers by postcode. The users should be able to enter a search term to explore items that the suppliers offer.

## Sections of the app to build

### Frontend
Build using predominantly React and likely some redux. The frontend will show input fields for postcode and search terms and the page should include a map.

Will need to use the form field and submit handlers to call the backend or the api?

Should I spin up a quick create-react-app instance or try to do from scratch.

### Backend
Build using Node.js with Express (maybe have a look at Koa as well).
How does the backend fit into this app. Will it be mostly to call the api and organise the response?

Do I need a proper backend? What will that really be composed of?

Interacting with the current public API
What I can and cant access? How do I go about accessing it. 


### Design
Probably step through the process likely a multi step process (postcode > category > search) showing examples at each stage if possible.

Do we need to do the steps in order? maybe can use any combination of relevant inputs? 

Do initial sketches on paper but maybe higher quality designs in Figma later. 

### Map

What do we need to show in the map? are we just putting a placeholder map? Do we need to have it respond to the input terms or to the request?
